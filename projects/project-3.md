## Dream restaurant.
This project is mainly about how to use local and global variables. This is the first main project I had finished during high schoolâ€”an online ordering page for a restaurant. You can order the food you like, which sums up after you check out. There are different pages for different food, saving up the data.

## Personal.
It is a personal project, so I had to finish it all by myself. It is a fun project, and I regret staying at lunch to finish it, especially when I was hungry and scanning through the image of delicious foods online to put in my menus. We had to learn how to use local and global variables and catch any problems that the professor had found. I didn't solve the problem of if the user input a negative number for the food's amount ordered. A negative balance appears during the website. RIP

## Ready?
Writing code for business is not easy, and you need to be 100% bug solve for it. I didn't catch the error of the user inputting a negative number, and if that happens in real life, everyone can order free food! 

## Sorry!!!
The code is in my old flash drive and it is lost. NO LINK...
