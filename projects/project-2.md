## UNKNOWN RELATIONSHIP WITH POKEMON
The whole ICS central theme I had gone through during KCC is pokemon. To be honest, I don't know why. Every subject or assignment we go through, my professor can link it with the pokemon game. Whether random function for the levels or pokemon your catches, the hp, mp, even the evolution of the pokemon. Every assignment we go through builds up to our final project. In different parts of the project, we can work with different teammates. We could share our code with different teammates to improve, and it's fun to see other ideas for the project. 

## Teamwork. 

The final project is developing the pokemon game, but only the catch screen. Like the pokemon go. Although we had learned how to use Java for the battles for the pokemon, we decided to do just the catching screen. We can catch different levels of pokemon and its different evolutions. Also, random hp and mp when it caught and, most importantly, randomizes chances of catching it. We designed our catching screen and different images of the pokemon. 

## I am Sorry!
The assignment is under the main tag of my professor, and it is set to be private. So, no link. I am sorry.
