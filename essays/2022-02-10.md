## The personal style of coding standards. 

When do you realize that coding standards matter? When working with others? Or when reviewing your code a couple of days later? For me, it is all that, for example, during ICS 111. There is an assignment I started on Monday and restarted on Friday. It means there are three days of blank for me to recognize the project. So, when I resumed my assignment on Friday, I felt that "What the F*** am I writing on Monday?". Without coding standards, it just makes it difficult to resume. For example, those spaces after ";, ()" or blank after the last line and many more standards make a piece of code much more understandable for yourself and others to review.
