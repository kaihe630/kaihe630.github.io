## Do coding standards Matters? 

When do you realize that coding standards matter? When working with others? Or when reviewing your code a couple of days later? For me, it is all that, for example, during ICS 111. There is an assignment I started on Monday and restarted on Friday. Which means there are three days of blank for me to recognize the project. So, when I resumed my assignment on Friday, I felt that "What the F*** am I writing on Monday?". Without coding standards, it just makes it difficult to resume a piece of code or even for reviewing. For example, those spaces after ";, ()" or blank after the last line and many more standards make a piece of code much more understandable for yourself and others to review. 

## The personal standards. 

Everyone's coding standards are different. But, the purpose of coding standards for everyone is the same. Make reviewers, including yourself, have the more effortless experience of understanding that piece of code. So, you don't have to think hard about the specific part of code you write in the past. Also, others don't have to feel confused when looking at your code. Having coding standards while working with others makes it easier to understand your code.
