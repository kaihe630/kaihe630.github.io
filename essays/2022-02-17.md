## What is RadGrad?

What was the main stuff we looking for as college students? Knowledge? Bright future? A high pay job? Or to look smart? There are a lot more reasons. But, one of the most critical reasons we are looking for is a high pay job after graduating. But, it is hard to find a satisfying career with high pay. Lucky we had the RadGrad! This feature is significant and helpful. We could explore subjects we are interested in and exciting careers, courses, and opportunities, which is fantastic! We also could develop a planner for all that. This feature is handy. Many ICS college students wander around with its future and are unsure what to do, but RadGrad takes advantage of that.

There are six levels in RadGrad. They all stand for different things. It isn't easy to level up. I am currently level two and looking forward to a higher level. Level one is for those beginners of ICS majors who have not yet completed any courses or opportunities. Level two is those who have finished a single semester of coursework. Level three is those who spent two semesters of coursework. Yes, level four completed three semesters of coursework, but the additional requirement of least 100 Innovation, 100 Competency, and 100 Experience. Levels five and six are really to enter workplaces and mean it had made significant progress toward 100 verified points in each of the three my ICE categories. My goal is to be at level six, although I am still level two, as I am still in ICS, I will work my way through. 

## Overall

Overall, I think RadGrad is an excellent tool to map out our future. The feature of the planner is incredible. And the fact we could review each different ICS course is time-saving. We can view the past ICS course that we had passed and write reviews about them. This feature is excellent, and I wish I had known RadGrad much earlier. So I could look at reviews of the course in general.  RadGrad provides us a guideline to guild you, though it is helpful. Significantly for those who had no elder to help out its graduate plan. Honestly, many students first decided their major. Most of them felt lost and unsure what to do next. With the help of RadGrad, our ICS students had the advantage to discover they're interested in ICS in RadGrad.
