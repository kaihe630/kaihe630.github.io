## What is RadGrad?

What was the main stuff we looking for as college students? Knowledge? Bright future? A high pay job? Or to look smart? There are a lot more reasons. But, one of the most critical reasons we are looking for is a high pay job after graduating. But, it is hard to find a satisfying career with high pay. Lucky we had the RadGrad! This feature is significant and helpful. We could explore subjects we are interested in and exciting careers, courses, and opportunities, which is fantastic! We also could develop a planner for all that. This feature is handy. Many ICS college students wander around with its future and are unsure what to do, but RadGrad takes advantage of that.
