## Understanding Design Pattern

Haven't you ever seen the term design patterns in programming? What are design patterns, and how are you used in your code? These questions commonly pop out during interviews, and if you don't know anything about it, you are in trouble. Yes, I am in trouble. When I first saw the term design patterns, I thought about the patterns of pages you design. Like a menu at the top, several functions at the body, and a footer at the bottom of the page. Those repeat designs. But, that is not really what design patterns are. Design patterns are something way more than that. By Christopher Alexander, design patterns "describe a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice"(1977). To me, it means design patterns are a pattern of solutions that we could use to solve a problem that can appear in many different scenarios. Basically, it means a re-useable form of solutions.
