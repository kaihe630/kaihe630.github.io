## Laziness is pushing us forward.

What is the number one reason for the programmer to keep creating new technology? I believe laziness is the reason, at least to me. Why? All the latest technology that programmers create is to make things easy or save time. Why are UI Frameworks so popular? With UI Frameworks, you could save up a massive amount of time and develop a website easier. I had never used any UI Frameworks before ICS314, and the experience of using Semantic UI is incredible. It's just a little bit confusing when trying to search up functions and suit a way to use it. But, overall is excellent.

## HTML/CSS & Semantic UI.

Why is HTML/CSS is considered the old way of developing a website and Semantic UI is the newer way? The answer is pretty simple. Creating a modern website is much easier and quicker with semantic UI than using HTML/CSS. Here are the examples of why. The website's image at the top was written with HTML/CSS, and the bottom was written with semantic UI. The difference is significant, and the time too. It is much longer using HTML/CSS and much easier with Semantic UI. The coolest part is that we don't need much CSS to involve Semantic UI. Most importantly, the code is reliable!

## Pros. And cons?

What were the pros of using the UI framework and its cons? There are a lot more pros than cons. UI framework is helpful with creating stylized and professional-looking websites. It is user-friendly with starters, and there are many reliable templates of code you can find online. That means a beginner might bruit a professional-looking website easily. There is a lot of advantage of using the UI framework. But there is still some disadvantage of it. Something like, if the library of the UI framework updates and your website might be messed up with that update. Most importantly, you might be relied too much on using the UI framework and forget the traditional coding skill. Also, I am pretty sure your boss will be disappointed when he asks you to builts a website for its company and asks you what kind of skill you have, and your answer is "I am a pro at using UI framework."
